* Getting More in Everything

# Myself Guide Line
* Focus on the process, not the reward. Understanding that all the steps you undertake can lead you to your desired outcome is key.
* Transform your bad habit of daydreaming into guiding yourself to imagine all sorts of possibilities in real life.
* 
* 讓你的心情專注在讓讓自己身邊的人可以變得更好，所謂的變得更好，包含實際生活和心情，而且是長期理性下可以變得更好的原則，非什麼都好的溺愛，
