# Getting Things Done" (GTD)
### Core Principles of GTD
1. **Managing Open Loops**: The book emphasizes managing 'open loops' — tasks, commitments, and ideas that pull our attention. Unmanaged, they contribute to overwhelm and stress【54†source】.
2. **Defining 'Done' and 'Doing'**: GTD requires defining what "done" means and what "doing" looks like in practical steps【55†source】.
3. **Workflow Mastery**: This involves capturing what has your attention, clarifying it, organizing it, frequently reviewing it, and engaging with it effectively【55†source】【58†source】.
4. **Two-Minute Rule**: If an action can be completed in less than two minutes, it should be done immediately【55†source】【60†source】.
5. **Utilizing Your Mind**: The mind is for having ideas, not holding them. Stress often comes not from too much to do, but from broken agreements with oneself about these unmanaged commitments【55†source】【56†source】.

### Workflow Process
1. **Capture Everything**: Keep every open loop in a capture system and out of your head, with as few capturing buckets as possible, and empty them regularly【59†source】.
2. **Processing and Organizing**: Identify whether items are actionable. If not, categorize them as trash, incubate, or reference. If actionable, do it (if less than two minutes), delegate it, or defer it【60†source】.
3. **Prioritizing and Organizing Tools**: Use calendars for time-specific actions, day-specific actions, and day-specific information. Next Actions lists are central to daily action management【63†source】【64†source】.
4. **No-Action Systems**: This includes trash, incubation tools (like Someday/Maybe lists or a tickler system), and reference systems【65†source】.
5. **Weekly Review**: Regularly review all your projects, plans, and actions to keep your system up-to-date and aligned with your priorities【66†source】【67†source】.

### Choosing Actions and Daily Work
1. **Four-Criteria Model for Choosing Actions**: Consider context, time available, energy available, and priority when deciding what to do at any moment【68†source】.
2. **Threefold Model for Identifying Daily Work**: This includes doing predefined work, work as it shows up, and defining new work【69†source】.
3. **Six-Level Model for Reviewing Work**: Review your work at six levels - from current actions to life purpose and principles【70†source】.

### Overarching Themes and Insights
1. **Relaxed Control**: The key to productivity is having clearly defined outcomes (projects) and next actions, with reminders in a trusted system【71†source】.
2. **Decision Making and Clarity**: Understanding the purpose of your actions, and maintaining a clear inventory of tasks, helps in making informed decisions and reduces stress【72†source】【83†source】.
3. **Organizational Tools and Habits**: Effective productivity involves loving the tools you use for organizing and understanding the complete picture of your tasks【73†source】【85†source】.
4. **Handling Overwhelm and Disorganization**: The GTD method is about managing distractions and disorganization, which are major sources of stress in the modern world【94†source】.

In essence, "Getting Things Done" provides a detailed framework for enhancing productivity and efficiency, primarily through the organization of tasks and commitments. It emphasizes the importance of a clear mind, systematic processing of tasks, and regular review to manage work and personal life effectively. For anyone looking to improve their organizational skills and reduce stress, GTD offers a comprehensive and practical approach.
